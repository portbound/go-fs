# go-fs

## What?
A file sharing platform built with Go

## Why? 
The personal tier Dropbox subscription is $11.99/mo ($9.99/mo billed annually)
I do not need 2TB, but the free tier only comes with 2GB.

The goal here is to build my own solution using some sort of cloud storage and a baremetal VPS to try and get the cost lower.

$9.98/mo is a win in my book
